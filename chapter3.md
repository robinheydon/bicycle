# On-Road Design

When designing routes for bicycles that follow the same path as motorised vehicles, special care has to be taken to ensure that safety is provided.

## Types of on-road bicycle infrastructure

### No infrastracture

A road without any bicycle infrastructure is classified as having "no infrastructure". This means that there are no dedicated areas reserved for bicycles within the road space.

### Advisory cycle lane

An advisory cycle lane is a lane for bicycles marked with a dashed line. Advisory cycle lanes do not prohibit vehicles from entering the cycle lane nor stopping within the lane to load and unload. If parking is allowed then the value of the advisory cycle lane is reduced. It is therefore suggested that the use of double yellow lines along with advisory cycle lanes will prevent such parking.

Advistory cycle lanes are bounded by a 100 mm wide white line to diagram
1004 where the speed limit is 40 mph or less, or 1004.1 where it is greater than 40 mph. It is recommended to use a different colour aggregate for the cycle lane. It is also recommended to use diagram 1057 within the advisory cycle lane at the exit to junctions as well as at the start of the route.

### Mandatory cycle lane

A mandatory cycle lane is a lane for bicycles marked with a continuous line.

Mandatory cycle lanes are bounded by a 150 mm wide continuous white line to diagram 1049. It is recommended to use a different colour aggregate for the cycle lane. Across road junctions, the mandatory cycle lane should be signed using diagram 1004 or diagram 1004.1 with diagram 1057 used at the resumption of diagram 1049. It is also recommended to use diagram 1057 within the advisory cycle lane at the exit to junctions as well as at the start of the route.

It is not necessary to use diagram 1004 or 1004.1 at private entrances or exits to the road as access can be exempted in the traffic regulation order.

### Hybrid cycle lane

A hybrid cycle lane is a separate lane for bicycles that is adjacent to the main vehicular carriageway that is demarked using a kerb.

### Light protection cycleway

A light protection cycleway is a separate lane for bicycles that is adjacent to the main vehiclar carriageway that is demarked with phyiscal objects between the moving vehicles and the cycleway. Such physical objects would include "armadillos" or "plant boxes". It is also possible to provide light protection of cycleways using a minimum space of at least 2m. 

### Protected cycleway

## Design Considerations

The design of on-road bicycle infrastructure starts from two very simple variables:

* volume of motorised traffic
* speed of motorised traffic

## Why volume of motorised traffic is important

## Why speed of motorised traffic is important

## Bicycle infrastructure requirements

### 20 mph roads

### 30 mph roads

### Fast roads
