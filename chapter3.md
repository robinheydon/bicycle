## Types of on-road bicycle infrastructure

### No infrastracture

### Advisory cycle lane

### Mandatory cycle lane

### Hybrid cycle lane

### Light protection cycleway

### Protected cycleway

The design of on-road bicycle infrastructure starts from two very simple variables:

* volume of motorised traffic
* speed of motorised traffic

## Why volume of motorised traffic is important

## Why speed of motorised traffic is important

## Bicycle infrastructure requirements

### 20 mph roads

### 30 mph roads

### Fast roads
