# On-Road Design

When designing routes for bicycles that follow the same path as motorised vehicles, special care has to be taken to ensure that safety is provided.

Within this section, places where bicycles are provided space are called either cycle lanes or cycleways. A cycle lane is logically part of the main carriageway, either at the same level as the motorised traffic, or at a slightly higher level but immediately adjacent to the motorised traffic. A cycleway is separated from the main motorised traffic using kerbs or other objects or using distances of buffer space.

## Types of on-road bicycle infrastructure

### No infrastracture

A road without any bicycle infrastructure is classified as having "no infrastructure". This means that there are no dedicated areas reserved for bicycles within the road space.

### Advisory cycle lane

An advisory cycle lane is a lane for bicycles marked with a dashed line. Advisory cycle lanes do not prohibit vehicles from entering the cycle lane nor stopping within the lane to load and unload. If parking is allowed then the value of the advisory cycle lane is reduced. It is therefore suggested that the use of double yellow lines along with advisory cycle lanes will prevent such parking.

Advistory cycle lanes are bounded by a 100 mm wide white line to diagram
1004 where the speed limit is 40 mph or less, or 1004.1 where it is greater than 40 mph. It is recommended to use a different colour aggregate for the cycle lane. It is also recommended to use diagram 1057 within the advisory cycle lane at the exit to junctions as well as at the start of the route.

### Mandatory cycle lane

A mandatory cycle lane is a lane for bicycles marked with a continuous line.

Mandatory cycle lanes are bounded by a 150 mm wide continuous white line to diagram 1049. It is recommended to use a different colour aggregate for the cycle lane. Across road junctions, the mandatory cycle lane should be signed using diagram 1004 or diagram 1004.1 with diagram 1057 used at the resumption of diagram 1049. It is also recommended to use diagram 1057 within the advisory cycle lane at the exit to junctions as well as at the start of the route.

It is not necessary to use diagram 1004 or 1004.1 at private entrances or exits to the road as access can be exempted in the traffic regulation order.

### Hybrid cycle lane

A hybrid cycle lane is a separate lane for bicycles that is adjacent to the main vehicular carriageway that is demarked using a kerb. Such hybrid cycle lanes can either be segregated using a single 90º kerb with a 60 mm upstand, or a 30º kerb with a 25mm upstand. If parking restrictions are required, then single or double yellow lines should be placed on the vehicular carriageway.

The height of the hybrid cycle lane should slightly higher than the main carriageway but lower than the pedestrian footway. This allows pedestrians to always feel safe walking of the highest surface, the motorists to understand that they should be driving on the lowest surface, and people riding bicycles on the hybrid cycle lane will take the middle layer.

### Light protection cycleway

A light protection cycleway is a separate lane for bicycles that is adjacent to the main vehiclar carriageway that is demarked with phyiscal objects between the moving vehicles and the cycleway. Such physical objects would include "armadillos" or "plant boxes". It is also possible to provide light protection of cycleways using a minimum space of at least 2 metres. This space should be filled with material that cannot be driven over, such as grass or planting such as trees.

Light protection cycleways should be uni-directional in the same direction as the main carriageway.

### High protection cycleway

A high protection cycleway is a completely segregated cycleway that is separated from the motor vehicle carriageway using kerbs, continuous planting or a minimum space of at least 4 metres.

High protection cycleways that are protected with kerbs should have an island between the main motorised carriageway and the cycleway that have 90º kerbs with a 60 mm upstand on the motorised carriageway side and 30º kerbs on the cycleway side. The island should be at least 600 mm wide. The middle of the island can either be grassed, or hard surfaced. Where the island width is sufficient, bicycle parking should be provided.

High protection cycleways that are protected with continuous planting should use either a hedge or regularly planted trees such that the location is considered attractive to ride along.

High protection cycleways that are protected with a buffer space of 4m or more are mainly used in rural areas where the right of way width is sufficient. The buffer space can include car parking, trees, grass, drainage ditches and other road management systems. If the main motor carriageway is lighted, then the cycleway must also have lighting provided. If the motor carriageway is not lighted, then the cycleway should still be provided with lighting to increase the perceived safety for people riding bicycles, especially lone females.

High protection cycleways can be built as bi-directional cycleways as long as the junctions sufficiently consider the impact bicycles travelling in both directions when motorists may not be expecting such traffic flows.

## Design Considerations

The determination of the type of on-road bicycle infrastructure is primarily determined by two factors.

* volume of motorised traffic
* speed of motorised traffic
* effective width of cycle space

The main issue being addressed in determining the type of on-road bicycle infrastructure is the perceived and actual safety for people riding bicycles such that the impact of each passing motorised vehicle is minimised. The more frequently a vehicle passes somebody on a bicycle, the closer that they pass, and the higher speed that they pass, the more the perceived safety is reduced. The distance that vehicles will pass is mostly determined by the effective width of the cycle space.

### Why volume of motorised traffic is important

The volume of motorised traffic is critical to determining the type of on-road bicycle infrastructure required. Very quiet roads require significantly less bicycle infrastructure than very busy roads. Typically, a very quiet road in a residential area will require no bicycle infrastructure at all as the probability of somebody passing the person on a bicycle is so small that the road will feel like it is very safe.

As the volume traffic increases, it reaches a point that people riding bicycles will be holding up car traffic. If no bicycle infrastructure is provided, then people driving cars will have to overtake these bicycles and some drivers will do so with too little space, cut in too early as traffic approaches from the other direction, or take too much risk in overtaking when they really shouldn’t be. These interactions cause great risk to those riding bicycles and decreases the willingness to use such roads. It is therefore necessary to increase the quality of the bicycle infrastructure as the volume of traffic increases.

Another issue that must be considered is the segregation between bicycles and  motorised vehicles when they pass each other. Where there is no bicycle infrastructure, the driver of the motorised vehicle has to guess how much space they should be providing, and typically they provide less space to what they perceive to be experienced cyclists. When bicycle infrastructure is provided then drivers of motorised vehicles may not move to the side to provide sufficient space for people on bicycles. Therefore the width of the bicycle infrastructure is vitally important to ensure that the feeling of safety is maintained as the volume of traffic increases. 

### Why speed of motorised traffic is important

The speed of motorised traffic also a critical factor in how people riding bicycles will feel about a piece of on-road bicycle infrastructure. When vehicular speeds are low, the driver of motorised vehicles approach a person riding a bicycle slowly and have plenty of time to decide whether to stay back and wait to overtake or to overtake immediately. This allows the person on the bicycle to feel safe in the knowledge that cars will not race up behind them and do an emergency brake as potential overtaking opportunities disappear.

As the speed of motorised traffic increases noise and other pollution levels  increase and therefore it becomes progressively less attractive to ride a bicycle next to such traffic. This means that greater segregation of bicycle traffic and motorised traffic is needed as the speed of motorised traffic increases.

### Measuring the volume of traffic

Measuring the volume of traffic is normally an expensive and time consuming exercise. Typically traffic volumes are recorded as PCUs, passenger car units, which equates larger vehicles to a numerically higher PCU value, whilst motorbikes are given a value less than one. This accurately reflects that being passed by a bus or a heavy goods vehicle has significantly more impact than being passed by a motorbike.

The PCUs value is typically denoted as an Average Annual Daily Flow AADF value. This is logically the total number of vehicles that pass a given point a year divided by the number of days in a year. For example, a road that has 250,000 cars pass a given point a year would have an AADF value of 684.

The AADF figure unfortunately doesn’t capture the impact of rush hour traffic on such a figure. For example, the above example road could be an access route to a stadium that enables 10,000 vehicles to park at the stadium for 25 days a year. Alternatively, it could be a quiet residential street providing access to a housing estate of a few hundred houses. In the case of the housing estate, the majority of the car trips would be within the peak hour.

It is typically assumed that 50% of the car trips would occur during the rush hours, and that the other 50% are spread over the rest of the day. If the rush hour was defined to be say 8am till 9am and 5pm till 6pm, then 342 vehicles would use the access route in an hour, a vehicle every 10 seconds. The other 342 vehicles would be spread over the other 22 hours, a vehicle every 4 minutes.

If an estimate of AADF PCUs values are to be quickly estimated, then measuring vehicles out of rush hour may provide very inaccurate figures. It is therefore recommended that measuring the number of vehicles passing along a road during the local rush hour, or a proportion of it, and then estimating the total number of vehicles during the day.

For example, when stood by a road you counted 134 vehicles passing a point in 15 minutes, then it could be assumed that in the full rush hour there would have been 536. This means that during both rush hours, the road would be moving 1,072, and the rest of the time it would be moving another 1,072 cars. Adding the rush hour and “non-rush hour” figures together gives a final PCU value of 2144 PCUs.

It should be noted that main routes within a city typically have much higher volume of traffic out of rush hour. However, many of these routes have traffic counts collated by the Department for Transport and available on the internet.

### Measuring vehicular speeds

The 85% percentile of actual traffic speeds should be used when determining the speeds of traffic, and not the posted speed limit. It is an unfortunate fact that the majority of motorised traffic fails to obey the legal speed limits, and therefore the 85% percentile of the actual traffic speeds is a more accurate statistic to use.

The 85% percentile traffic speeds is the speed at which 85% of people will be traveling below and 15% will be travelling above. It is always desirable to have the 85% percentile traffic speeds to be below the speed limit, however on many roads the 85% percentile traffic speeds are above or even significantly above the speed limit.

## Bicycle infrastructure separation requirements

To enable a very simple determination of the most appropriate bicycle infrastructure, the following sub-sections identify the requirements for each of three different speed bands for a given traffic volume.

The first speed band is for measured traffic speeds of up to 20 mph. These speeds are the most compatible with bicycle traffic and therefore require less separation and less expensive bicycle infrastructure.

The second speed band is for measured traffic speeds between 21 mph and 39 mph. These speeds require more separation of motorised vehicles and bicycle traffic although it may be possible to provide cycle lanes rather than cycleways.

The third speed band is for measured traffic speeds of 40 mph and higher. The speed of traffic on such roads requires the maximum level of separation of motorised vehicles and bicycle traffic and therefore cycleways are typically the most appropriate infrastructure.

For each of the three speed bands, the infrastructure will be classified based on the annual average daily flow of PCUs and by the separation score required. The separation scores are:

## Effective Width of cycle lanes and cycleways

The effective width of cycle lanes or cycleways is of major importance to the perceived safety for people who ride a bicycle. The further that high speed motorised vehicles pass the less impact they will have on the bicycle rider. For example, the turbulent wake of air to the side and behind the vehicle will be less as the distance between the vehicles increases.

The effective width is determined by two factors. The first is the space allocated on the ground for bicycle traffic. The second reduces this space by considering the type of kerb, lighting poles, walls, signposts, and car parking as obstructions to the use of the full width of the bicycle infrastructure.

### Kerbs

A 30º or shallower kerb does not reduce the effective width of a cycleway or cycle lane.

A kerb that is 31º or steeper reduces the effective width of the cycleway or cycle lane by 500 mm.

A kerb that is higher than 60mm reduces the effective width of a cycleway or cycle lane by another 500 mm.

For example, a cycleway has a 30º kerb on the left side and a 90º kerb that has an upstand of 75 mm would have an effective width of one metre less than it’s measured width.

### Sign posts and lighting columns

A sign post or lighting column within the cycleway or cycle lane is considered a complete failure.

A sign post or lighting column that is within 1m of the edge of the cycleway reduces the effective width by 1000 mm.

### Walls

A wall that is within 1m of the edge of the cycleway reduces the effective width by 1000 mm.

### Car parking

Car parking that is within 500 mm of the edge of the cycleway reduces the effective width by 1000 mm.

### Moving motorised vehicles

Moving motorised vehicles that are within 500 mm of the cycleway reduces the effective width by 500 mm.

### Bicycle capacity

The capacity of a cycleway or cycle lane is a function of its effective width and whether the bicycle traffic is uni-directional or bi-directional and whether the bi-directional traffic is mostly tidal or non-tidal.

The typical dynamic envelope of a bicycle is approximately 1 m. Bicycles passing each other need at least 0.1 m of space to pass. Therefore any cycleway or cycle lane that has an effective width of less than 2.1 m can only carry a single “lane” of bicycle traffic. This also implies that it is only until you have an effective width of 3.2 m that a cycleway or cycle lane be able to carry three “lanes” of uni-directional bicycle traffic. Also, for bicycle traffic moving at significantly different speeds the passing distance of 0.5 m will be required, and therefore a width of 2.5 m is considered a good start.

Bi-directional cycleways are more complex than uni-directional cycleways or cycle lanes as they have to accommodate bicycle traffic passing in the opposite direction. This requires an additional 0.5 m of space between the two directions of flow. Therefore the minimum width of a bi-directional cycleway is 2.5 m. When an additional lane of bicycle traffic is introduced, the second lane is considered to be a social lane. Social cycling is a very important characteristic of a cycling culture to allow children and parents to ride side by side and also allow two adults to ride side by side and chat with each other.  A group of cyclists riding socially do not require any additional space, and therefore two bicycles being ridden side by side would have a width of 2.0 m. A “three lane” tidal flow bi-directional cycleway that has two lanes in one direction and one lane in the other therefore require 3.5 m of space.

Each lane of uni-directional bicycle traffic can typically accommodate 600 bicycles an hour, mainly due to junction capacity along the route. Therefore a 1.5 m cycle lane would be able to move these 600 bicycles, whilst a 2.1 m cycle lane could accommodate 900 bicycles an hour, and a 2.5 m cycle lane would accommodate 1,200 bicycles an hour. If these capacities are rush hour volumes, then the AADF of such a 2.5 m cycle lane would allow 4,800.

A lane of bi-directional bicycle traffic can typically only accommodate 400 bicycles an hour, mainly due to the reduced capacity associated with trying to overtake slower cyclists. A 3.0 m bi-direction cycleway would have a capacity of 800 bicycles per hour, whilst a 4.0 m bi-direction cycleway would therefore have a capacity of 1,200 bicycles per hour. These would relate to an AADF of 3,200 and 4,800 respectively.

Bicycle traffic is normally more “peaky” than car traffic however in some locations, for example a major orbital cycle route or a major radial route, the bicycle traffic levels can be high throughout the day. In such locations, the AADF figures for bicycle traffic may be significantly higher. For example, in such locations, a single 2.1 m cycle lane may accommodate up to 12,800 bicycles a day. However, along such corridors the capacity of junctions may be the limiting factor in realising such bicycle traffic flows.

The theoretical capacity figures however also have to factor in the attractiveness of these routes. A 2.5 m cycle lane for example would allow a 4,800 bicycles to move along it a day, but a 1.5 m cycle lane should be able to accommodate 2,400 bicycles yet because it is such a poor facility may only attract a quarter of that figure, 600.

## Quality Level

Using the effectiveness score and the separation score, the quality level of a segment of infrastructure can be determined using one of the following five classifications:

- world class
- good practice
- very poor
- unacceptable
- complete failure

World class bicycle infrastructure is that used in places that have upwards of 45% of the citizens cycling on an average day, where traffic jams don’t cripple the town or city, and where the actual safety of bicycles is the highest. The majority of people cycling will be female, with children moving around independently and elderly people going on bicycle rides. 

Good practice bicycle infrastructure is that which is considered to increase the levels of cycling in an area. Good practice infrastructure will allow for cycling levels of up to 22% of citizens cycling on an average day, but traffic jams won’t disappear because way too many people are still compelled to drive around due to a perceived safety risk. The majority of people are younger male adults. A few children will be allowed to cycle but the vast majority will be forced to experience the city trapped behind walls of glass and metal.

Very poor bicycle infrastructure is that which will not be considered to provide sufficient perceived safety and therefore the vast majority of people will not be enticed into cycling. Cycling levels of up to 10% may be possible but traffic jams will paralyse the town or city. Many people will argue that it would be foolish to remove space for cars because the traffic jams are already so bad. The people cycling are mostly all male, with few children or elderly people cycling.

Unacceptable bicycle infrastructure is that which actively discourages people from cycling because the level of safety required for people to cycle is not being provided. Traffic jams will be the main concern for local residents and businesses with expensive road widening projects being considered as the only way forward. Cycling levels of up to 4% may be possible, but most will be young and riding as fast as possible to reduce the speed differential between motorised-traffic and bicycle traffic. The use of lycra and bicycle helmets will be prominent and the number traffic collisions causing injury or death to people on bicycles will be higher than all other quality levels.

Complete failure is bicycle infrastructure that doesn’t even meet the levels required for the cycling levels to raise above trace levels. Cycling levels will be less than 2%. The majority of the bicycle infrastructure will have been provided just to enable politicians or developers to show that they are providing for cycling when they are still actively discouraging it. The levels of cycling in such locations will be so low that the number of traffic collisions involving bicycles will be declining again.
