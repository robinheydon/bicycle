# On-Road Design

When designing routes for bicycles that follow the same path as motorised vehicles, special care has to be taken to ensure that safety is provided.

## Types of on-road bicycle infrastructure

### No infrastracture

A road without any bicycle infrastructure is classified as having "no infrastructure".

### Advisory cycle lane

### Mandatory cycle lane

### Hybrid cycle lane

### Light protection cycleway

### Protected cycleway

The design of on-road bicycle infrastructure starts from two very simple variables:

* volume of motorised traffic
* speed of motorised traffic

## Why volume of motorised traffic is important

## Why speed of motorised traffic is important

## Bicycle infrastructure requirements

### 20 mph roads

### 30 mph roads

### Fast roads
