# Design Principles

When designing for bicycles, it is critical to understand a few basic concepts that will help people riding bicycles. Many of these concepts are identical to those used to design for other types of bicycles, but others are non-intuitive.

Many people assume that because there are different types of bicycles and different types of people who ride bicycles that there need to be different types of intrastructure. Terms such as "confident" or "non-confident" cyclist are used, without recognising that such terms are blaming people for not wanting to use poorly designed infrastructure.

Consider if different types of infrastructure were provided for motor-vehicles. This would be the equivalent to building separate motorways for heavy goods vehicles and motorcars. Whilst such separation may be benefitial from a safety point of view, but few locations warrant such an expensive waste of infrastructure for few benefits. For example, on motorways it is much cheaper to have a relatively similar maximum speed for cars and lorries than build two separate roadway systems with higher speeds allowed for cars.

Where different infrastructure is provided for different modes of motor-traffic, this is typically done to provide significant advantages for one type of traffic over others. For example, bus-only roads are provided to enable buses to avoid congested general traffic streets.

There should only be one type of bicycle infrastructure. It should be designed for all users of the infrastructure.

## Bicycle Riders

To understand how bicycle infrastructure will be used, it is necessary to understand who will use them. Given that there is no "bicycle test" or even a requirement to obtain a bicycle licence, many may assume that bicycle riders are all lawless individuals. However, many schools include bicycle training as part of their curriculum, and many people who use a bicycle have passed their driving tests. There is no assumption that people on bicycles are any more likely to break the law than people driving motor-vehicles. Except that when somebody driving makes a mistake the consequences are typically much more serious than if somebody riding a bicycle makes a similar mistake.

### All ages and abilities

By the age of eight years old, a typical child will have enough comprehension of traffic and the rules of the road to be able to ride a bicycle. The majority of the time they may be accompanied by an adult to help them interpret the road. Such riders will be highly enthusiastic and enjoy the thrill of piloting their own vehicle, and being given such responsibility.

By the age of eighty years old, the muscles of the body are starting to become weaker and therefore the ability to cycle long distances will become deminished. However, eyesight may become weaker over time, with the ability to see close up becoming weaker. The experience of the rider may be significantly better than a younger rider. Another advantage is that modern technology such as electric bicycles are enhancing the ability for the older generations to cycle further.

### Maintaining momentum

Riding a bicycle is the lowest energy form of transport that has ever been invented. Riding a bicycle uses less energy per kilometre than driving a car, being in a train or tram, or walking. However, starting and stopping uses significantly more energy than moving along at a constant speed. Most bicycle riders will automatically understand this and will try to maintain momentum up until the last possible moment before having to stop.

Each time a bicycle rider has to stop, the equivalent of 100 metres of distance is lost. This means that over a 2 km journey, if you have to stop every 50 metres, then the effective distance of that journey would be 6 km. Therefore, reducing the number of times that you have to stop could become a significant benefit for people riding bicycles.

## Sustainable safety

The concept of sustainable safety is a fundamental design paradigm that considers a number of aspects of human behavior and places the 
emphasis on mitigating bad decisions by humans. It does this using five principles:

   * functionality
   * homogeneity
   * recognizability
   * forgivingness
   * state awareness

All these principles are all build around the concept of measuring the abilities of humans and designing the infrastructure with those in mind. Therefore, to understand sustainable safety you have to understand how people are limited in their capabilities.

### Measuring human being

Human beings have evolved over the last 2 million years to be good at two basic things:

   * moving, typically running and walking
   * communicate, using signs and verbal communications 

Our ancient ancestors moved from living in trees to wandering the savanna to hunt for food. This moved us from quadrapeds to bi-pedal animals that walked on two legs in an upright position. This position was optimised for moving long distances efficiently. Walking and then running evolved to allow us to hunt prey by tiring them out.

This increased the proportion of animal protein that we consumed allowing for more energy to be allocated to our brains. This allowed us to become smarter in how we hunted those animals, hunting in packs, building weapons, and communicating complex instructions to our fellow hunters. Eventually this allows us to communicate using languages, produce drawings, and eventually modern machinery.

Recent history only started with the invention of agriculture where we stayed in a single location and grew crops in the land around a permanent settlement. These settlements grew, along with the organisational structures required to enable them to prosper. This included governments, the rule of law, and courts used to measure actions against those laws.

In just 10,000 years, or about 400-500 generations, the human race will not have evolved much from our ancesters who survived for hundreds of thousands of years. We still have just two eyes that can be focused on one thing and can detect movement in our peripheral vision if it is big enough. We still have just two ears that can detect the direction that sound comes from, but only higher frequencies. We still have a single brain that can become easily distracted.

However, we can perform autonomous tasks without thinking. Once we have learnt to walk we don't think about walking, we just walk. It is the same with cycling, or driving a car. It is hard at the start, but once you have learnt how to do it it becomes easy. So easy that some people will tune-out and allow themselves to cycle or drive without concentrating on what is happening.

#### Decisions

Humans are good at making decisions if they have a simple scenario to deal with. Should I run to the left or the right to catch the wild animal I am hunting? Should I speed up or slow down? Should I communicate with others what my intentions are?

Humans are not very good at making good decisions when they have to understand a complex situation. As such, if the infrastructure design requires them to assess multiple variables at the same time, then they will probably only concentrate on the bigger threat and ignore the insignificant threat. This is why people driving cars turning on to a road will see cars and not motorcycles or bicycles; those vehicles are not big enough to register as a threat.

#### Visibility

Humans can only see in one direction at a time. Whilst other animals can see all around them, for example many birds, humans have two eyes towards the front of the head that provide stereoscopic vision. The detailed vision of a human is also limited. Typically, the vision is very detailed in only a very small area of the visual area, with the brain building a more detailed model of the surrounding area and convincing us that we can actually see this detail, when in reality we can't.

This also means that we can only "see" one thing at a time. When we scan for other road users, we are only looking in the area that we think they will be, and if we don't see anything assume that everything is ok. Our mind will fill in the gaps and make us believe that there is nothing there.

This implies that when designing infrastructure, it would be best to design it such that each road user only need to check in one location at a time, and the decisions are made over time in a linear manner.
