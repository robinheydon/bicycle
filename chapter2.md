# Design Principles

When designing for bicycles, it is critical to understand a few basic concepts that will help people riding bicycles. Many of these concepts are identical to those used to design for other types of bicycles, but others are non-intuitive.

## Types of bicycle infrastructure

Many people assume that because there are different types of bicycles and different types of people who ride bicycles that there need to be different types of intrastructure. Terms such as "confident" or "non-confident" cyclist are used, without recognising that such terms are blaming people for not wanting to use poorly designed infrastructure.

Consider if different types of infrastructure were provided for motor-vehicles. This would be the equivalent to building separate motorways for heavy goods vehicles and motorcars. Whilst such separation may be benefitial from a safety point of view, but few locations warrant such an expensive waste of infrastructure for few benefits. For example, on motorways it is much cheaper to have a relatively similar maximum speed for cars and lorries than build two separate roadway systems with higher speeds allowed for cars.

Where different infrastructure is provided for different modes of motor-traffic, this is typically done to provide significant advantages for one type of traffic over others. For example, bus-only roads are provided to enable buses to avoid congested general traffic streets.

There should only be one type of bicycle infrastructure. It should be designed for all users of the infrastructure.
