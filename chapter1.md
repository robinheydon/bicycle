# What is a bicycle

To understand how to design infrastructure for bicycles it is first necessary to understand what a bicycle is, how they are used, who uses them, and what their design capacity and limitations are.

This review of a bicycle will consider bicycles of the “safety bicycle” design from 1885 onwards.


## Understanding a bicycle

Bicycles have existed in some form or another from 1816. In that year, Baron Karl von Drais invented a self powered machine to move around his employer’s estate because of the terrible crop failures provided such limited food for horses that the horses became too expensive to continue to feed and exercise. This machine consisted of two wheels connected with a piece of wood that the rider sat on and run along the ground, freewheeling whenever they wanted. 

The French then adapted this design by placing pedals on the front wheel. These machines were much easier to use but didn’t travel very quickly as the speed of the machine was limited by the size of the front wheel. Steering was also difficult due to rider having to sit over the front wheel. Eventually these machines grew in size until the “penny-farthing” became so big they had to be mounted when leaned up against a wall and dismounting was typically less graceful.

The safety bicycle, from John Kemp Starley of Coventry, placed the peddles in the middle of the frame, connected them by a chain to the rear wheel, and sat the rider as low as required to be able to stand up on the machine when stopped. The safety bicycle was an instant hit, creating the mass manufacturing of vehicles that would later catalyse the motor-vehicle manufacturers.

## Anatomy of a bicycle

The design of a bicycle, especially bicycles used by ordinary people to move around a town or city, is today very standardised. The components used are mass-produced around the world, and assembled into bicycles by numerous manufacturers.

When discussing the anatomy of a bicycle, the city bicycle will be used as an example. Other types of bicycles, such as mountain, touring, road, hybrid, or other more exotic styles, will be discussed later with the differences pointed out between those bicycles and an ordinary city bike.

### Frame

The frame of a bicycle is a combination of a high strength tubular steel arranged into a series of triangles. The steel The frame has six main components:

- seat tube
- top tube
- down tube
- head tube
- chain stay
- seat stay

The seat tube is the main steel tube that goes in a straight line from the seat to the pedals. The seat will slot into the seat tube and the seat height can then be adjusted by moving the seat up and down as required and then tightening the top of the seat tube to clamp onto the seat post.

At the bottom of the seat tube is the **WHATISITCALLED** to which the peddles are connected through.

The head tube is the second most important part of the bicycle. This is the tube that the steering is performed through. The handlebars are connected to the front forks through the head tube.

The head tube and the seat tube are connected together into a triangle with the top tube and the down tube. The down tube connects the head tube with the **WHATISITCALLED**. Whilst the top tube connects the seat tube higher up. There are two main styles of bicycle that can now be described based on how high the top tube connects to the seat tube. If the top tube connects low down on the seat tube then the bicycle is described as a “step-through” bicycle, whilst if the top tube connects high on the seat tube then the bicycle is described as a “step-over” bicycle. The step-over bicycle is typically slightly stronger than a step-through bicycle although much of this can be compensated for by using wider tubes or stronger materials.

The seat tube is also connected to the chain stay and seat stay in another triangle. The third point of connect is where the rear wheel is attached to the bicycle. The chain stay are the two tubes that connect from the seat stay to either side of the rear wheel. The seat stay connects with the seat tube fairly high up and allows a significant about of weight to be transferred through to the rear wheel from the seat.

This basic two-connected triangle arrangement has been the mainstay of lightweight bicycle design since 1885.

### Front fork

The front fork connects the handlebars directly to the front wheel. There are two forks that attach to either side of the front wheel and keep the front wheel in place. This fork is typically bent slightly forward near the bottom of the forks to provide some flexibility for rough road surfaces as well allowing the front wheel to return to centre when riding.

### Wheels

The front and rear wheels are typically very similar. Both have a rim that can have a bicycle tyre attached and a number of spokes that attache the rim to the central hub that connects with the chain stay or front forks. The spokes are designed to be incredibly light whilst also very strong.

### Brakes

A standard city bicycle will include hub brakes. Hub brakes are fully enclosed, don’t wear down the metal of the wheels or lose effectiveness when it is raining or after riding through water. Hub brakes, due to having much larger fiction surfaces also last much longer than other types of brakes.

### Hub gears

Hub gears are planetary gear sets that are fully enclosed within the rear wheel hub. Such gears do not require much maintenance and because they are fully enclosed cannot snag on any clothing or require resetting at the side of the road when they start to malfunction. Hub gears also have a significant advantage of being able to change to any gear when stationary, allowing somebody riding a bicycle to freewheel up to the junction and then change gear once stationary or just before speeding up again. Most low cost modern hub gears have 8-speeds although in flatter areas 3-speed hub gears are still very popular due to their simplicity.

### Hub dynamo

Generating electricity when a bicycle is moving forward is very useful for powering accessories such as lights, or recharging a mobile phone. Modern hub dynamos are very efficient taking hardly any force from the rotation of the bicycle wheel such that many people never bother turning off lights as it is more hassle to turn them on and off than just leave them on all the time.

### Integrated lights

Normal bicycles will have integrated lights, typically powered from a hub dynamo. The dynamo will power both the front and rear lights. These lights are typically based on LED technology today with lights that can easily output 70 lumens. It is also very common for such lights to also include a capacitor to store electricity when the bicycle is moving so that when it comes to a stop the front and rear lights stay on.

### Stand

To allow bicycles to be parked in any location, a bicycle stand will be attached between two chain stays. This stand will typically be one of two types. A single sided stand can hold the bicycle with three points touching the ground, the two wheels and the stand. This type of stand is very low cost but can be thwarted by strong winds and it is difficult to load the bicycle with the bicycle in such a stance. A two-sided stand holds the bicycle with three points touching the ground, one of the wheels and two points of the stand. This allows the bicycle to stay completely vertical allowing the bicycle to the loaded easily with cargo or other passengers like young children in bicycle child seats.

### Back rack

At the rear of the bicycle, a city bike will have a back rack that allows reasonably heavy loads to be carried. Such racks may also come with integrated elasticated cords to allow anything to be to attached to the bicycle even if you don’t have a bag available. However, mostly they are used for attaching panniers or bike bags. Bike bags attach to the back rack and typically are waterproof and easy to load up with supermarket or clothes shopping. Such racks can typically carry 50 kg of weight and may accommodate up to 80 litres of goods - sometimes more than a small city car can carry.

### Front basket

The front basket is more valuable as a place to put valuable items or items you may need during a trip, such as a map. Front baskets come in many shapes and sizes, although the bigger the better. Some front baskets attach to the handle bars, in which case the weight in the basket can affect the steering of the bicycle, although most larger baskets attach directly to the frame, typically the down tube, and the steering is not affected by carrying heavy loads. Front baskets can typically carry 25 kg and can accommodate up to 40 litres of goods.

### Handle bars

Apart from the seat and the pedals, the handle bars are the most important part of the bicycle that the rider will interact with. The handle bars on a city bicycle will be wide, swept back, and have very comfortable grips. The gears will typically located on the right hand side of the handle bars as a twist grip allowing the selection of gears without having to take your hands off the handlebars. The handle bars will also be attachment for the bell.

### Seat

The seat is the other main point of connection with the bicycle for the rider. The seat should be wide, soft, and most comfortable. Some seats include integrated suspension, although this does sometimes increase the strain on the knees of riders as the distance from the top of the legs to the pedals will continuously change length as the rider is moving along.

### Lock

An integrated wheel lock, attached between the seat stay and the chain stay and connecting through the rear wheel, is a major component of the security of the bicycle. In most countries a bicycle locked with just the rear wheel lock is considered sufficient for an insurance claim. Unfortunately the UK does not consider that sufficient and requires bicycles to be secured to immovable objects. This restricts the ability for towns and cities to rapidly accommodate rapid growing bicycle populations without building secure cycle parking. These wheel locks also typically have the ability to have a chain attach to the lock that can be looped through such immovable objects.

### Mud guards

Mud guards protect the rider of the bicycle from being splashed with dirty water from the road surface. Such water will be typically polluted water having had oil and rubber deposited along the roads from motor vehicles that are not maintained as well as perhaps they should be. Mud guards should be large enough that even when riding through deep puddles at the side of the road the feet, legs and back of the rider and any rider behind should not be splashed with this dirty water.

### Guards

The ability to ride a bicycle regardless of what clothes the rider is wearing is essential to allow people to just ride a bicycle like they can just use a vacuum cleaner. To enable this, most city bikes will have guards that protect the rider and their clothes from all moving parts.

The chain guard on a city bicycle will be a full guard completely enclosing the chain. This not only protects trousers from becoming entangled in the chain but also stops the chain being affected by rain or other weather meaning the chain requires less maintenance and lasts longer. Such chain guards are only possible on bicycles with hub gears, which is why hub gears are the gearing system of choice for city bicycles.

The skirt or coat guard is a guard that protects the clothes of the rider from being entangled in the rear wheel of the bicycle. This means that you can ride a bicycle in a long flowing skirt, or with a long flapping coat and not worry about having those items become dirty or trapped in the bicycle. This guard will also help stop any additional splashing of water from the rear wheel onto the clothes of the rider.

## Other styles of bicycle

### Touring

A touring bicycle is most like a city bicycle in that the geometry of the bicycle is designed to be very comfortable for long distances. It will typically have luggage racks and mud guards to make riding in normal clothes as easy as possible.

Touring bicycles may have **derailier** gears. This type of gearing system is very efficient and therefore used for long distance bicycles such as touring and racing bicycles. The chain is moved between one of number of different sized cogs attached to the rear wheel with a complicated mechanism to keep the chain tension and length the same. The major problems with these systems are that the gears can only be changed when pedalling, not a problem when touring or racing, but a significant problem if you have to do an emergency stop because car just pulled out in front of you without looking properly. They also restrict the use of chain guards increasing the cost of just getting onto the bicycle and moving off.

### Road

A road bicycle, also known as a racing bike or a sports bike, is typically just like a city bicycle except that everything that provides comfort and convenience is removed. Luggage racks, lights, mud guards, hub brakes are all removed to reduce weight. For brakes, such bikes will use rim brakes. Rim brakes rub against the metal of the wheel rim to slow down the bicycle. These brakes are severely effected by wet weather and also cause the rim of the wheels to wear, requiring replacement wheels to be purchased infrequently.

Road bicycles will typically have drop handlebars so that the rider can adopt a very streamlined posture to allow them to ride as fast as possible. Some road bicycles will also have “tri-bars” attached to the handlebars to allow for an even more optimised streamlined posture.

Road bicycles are mostly manufactured out of highly exotic materials. It is not uncommon to have a fully carbon fibre frame, carbon fibre wheels and magnesium alloy pedals to reduce the weight of the bicycle down as low as possible. Such technology is only today used in formula-one racing cars. Such bicycles can cost as much if not more than a small family car.

### Hybrid 

A hybrid bicycle is a compromise between a touring bicycle and a road bicycle. Typically they are sold at very low cost, having all the useful features of a city bike removed although they will have “straight” handlebars and less obsession of reducing weight. However, hybrid bicycles typically don’t come with the convenience features required for a cycling city such as hub gears, integrated lights, mud guards and the like. This means that as soon as winter and bad weather arrives the attraction of riding a bicycle is severely restricted.

## Other types of bicycle

There are many other types of bicycles that are common around a cycling city. Each performs a significantly different role in moving people or things from the ordinary bicycle.

### Cargo bicycle

The cargo bicycle is designed to move large quantities of stuff. They come in two main flavours, two wheeled, and three wheeled. The two-wheeled cargo bike has a typical city bike setup at the rear, but has a very large cargo carrying capacity between the handlebars and the front wheel.

The three-wheeled cargo bike can place the rider at the front or back and has a large box at the other end. Such cargo bikes may be used for last-mile delivery services or for transporting lots of children around a city.

### Tandem (or more)

Bicycles that allow more than one person to ride and pedal them allow people who cannot ride a bicycle alone or two people to travel further distances than they could alone.

Tandem bicycles are very popular for people who have mobility problems or sight problems where the love of riding a bicycle hasn’t been lost.

Typically a tandem has one person at the front who is in control of the steering and the brakes and can also pedal, and another person behind who is only responsible for pedalling. 

It is possible to have “tandems” for more than two people. Bicycles with up to four or five people are fairly common.

### Unicycle

The ultimate simplification of a bicycle is the unicycle. This has a single wheel, a seat tube, a seat, and pedals attached directly to the wheel. The speed  that can be achieved is determined by the size of the single wheel. To ride a unicycle requires huge amounts of skill and long distance riding is not that common although some people will commute to work on them.

### Recumbent

A recumbent bicycle is one where the rider sits very low between the two wheels. This significantly lowers the air resistance allowing such bicycles to achieve faster and longer distance rides than a normal city bicycles. Even though such bicycles would allow sports cyclists to go faster and further, the use of recumbent bicycles are banned by the sporting body for cycling and therefore their use is not as common as perhaps it could be.

Although the bicycle is very much longer and lower than an ordinary bicycle, the basic design is not that much different. The major difference is that the steering is typically done through handlebars below or just in front of the rider, and the chain has to be very long to accommodate the pedals at the front near the front wheel and the gears in the rear.

A variant on the recumbent bicycle is a recumbent tricycle. This will typically have two steering wheels so that the recumbent doesn’t fall over when it stops. Such recumbents are preferred by people who are mobility or balance problems where balancing the bicycle is not currently a problem.

### Tricycle

A tricycle is similar to an ordinary city bicycle except that there are two rear wheels. These machines cannot be ridden as quickly around corners as the rider cannot lean into the corner and therefore has to steer with the tricycle learning outwards. Tricycles are mostly used by people who have mobility or balance problems.

### Wheelchair bicycle

To allow everybody to enjoy riding bicycles there are designs for bicycles that have either two-riders sitting side by side or have a large tray at the front such that somebody in a wheelchair can be loaded onto the front and transported around on a bicycle. These bicycles are typically longer and wider than an average bicycle, but given that they also are transporting people who cannot ride a bicycle themselves, accommodation of such bicycles would be required by discrimination legislation.
